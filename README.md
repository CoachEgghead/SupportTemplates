# SupportTemplates
Windows application to manage support case templates.

Initially designed for support analysts, this application allows the user to save, recall, & delete common comment templates.  These are used in support centers when analysts are reusing the same text over and over.  Commonly they are saved in a Word document or a text document.  The user has to then scan through the document to find the needed template, has to highlight, copy, & then paste it into their case/ticket management system.

Support Templates takes the place of the document and provides a much easier method of finding and copying the needed template.  After the user's common templates are saved, he/she just clicks on the template name and the text is populated into the text box.  There is a 'Copy to Clipboard' button to have Windows read and save the text to the user's clipboard.  It can then be pasted into the other application(s).

The initial release is still a work in progress, so basically a beta of sorts.
